    <h1>An Exploration of Colour, Round One: The Good</h1>
    <p>I think that this colour scheme works to reinforce the message of my project in a number of ways. The font colour, header colour and background colour are triad, and so represent good colour choice on my part. I like the light yellow and dark red/dark blue because they are legible and stand out in an aesthetically pleasing way. I wanted to use red in this as it represents Indigenous people on their own colour wheel, and the other colours work with that. To be honest, I am going to work on this further in preparation for my assignment: I want to doscover how to more effectively convey my message through colour, but at this point I believe the choices I have made are aesthetically pleasing, do not take away from legibility, and add to my message through the symbolism of the red.</p>
