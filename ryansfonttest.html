    <h1>An Exploration of Font</h1>
    <p>I hope that the viewer, when seeing this page for the first time, thinks that I have done a good job deciding on fonts. Why they work together, in my mind, is because they carry about the same weight, and are the same height. They complement each other but do not detract from the words on the page. Considering the serious topic I have in mind for my final project, the straightness and subtlety of the fonts turns the focus to the serious subject matter and does not give the reader a whimsical feeling as some fonts might. Instead, they are rather heavy and simple, reinforcing the importance of my topic. The heaviness of the font will also make it easier to read I hope.</p>
