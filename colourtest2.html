    <h1>An Exploration of Colour, Round Two: The Bad and The Ugly</h1>
    <p>As you can clearly tell, this is a horrible use of colour on a website. Why is that? Well, bright red like this is a painful text to read from and makes the content unaccessible. Colourblind users will have a very difficult time engaging with the material as the background and paragraph colours are analagous as opposed to complementary or triad. On top of that, the header's green is complementary to the red of the background, but both are so bright and there is no difference in shade or tint that they still blend together. All in all, this is an incredibly ugly colour scheme.</p>
